This project demonstrates the calculation of histograms for ASCII characters in a matrix of randomly generated symbols. The solution is implemented in two variants:
1. **Variant 1**: Using the `Thread` class for parallel processing.
2. **Variant 2**: Using the `Runnable` interface for more flexible parallelization.

The project showcases:
- Sequential and parallel computation of histograms.
- Comparison of results to ensure correctness.
- Use of multithreading to improve performance.
